    "text": "Welcome to BiocPy\nBiocPy is designed to build a bridge between the mature Bioconductor ecosystem and the Python landscape. Bioconductor is an open-source software project that provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. One of the main advantages of Bioconductor is the availability of standard data representations and large number of analysis tools tailored for genomic experiments. These data structures allow researchers to seamlessly store, manipulate, and analyze data across multiple packages and workflows in R.\nInspired by Bioconductor, BiocPy aims to facilitate Bioconductor workflows in Python. To achieve this goal, we developed several core data structures that align closely to the Bioconductor implementations. By implementing these core Bioconductor data structures, BiocPy allows data to be easily interoperable between R and Python.",

These generics and utilities are provided through BiocUtils package, and the delayed and file-backed array operations in the DelayedArray and their derivatives (HDF5Array, TileDbArray).",
